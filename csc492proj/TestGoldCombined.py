                Welcome to {courseName}, {courseCode}. Your professor will be Dr. {prof_last_name} ({email}).

                Your course is being taught through Converse's Canvas. The simplest way to get in to Converse's Canvas is to go to https://converse.instructure.com and log in there with your Converse email and password.

                If you've taken a course with Converse before, your Converse email address and password will normally be unchanged from what they were. If you have a new Converse account, you should have gotten your Converse email address and password in a separate email from Campus Technology.

                Once logged in, you should be taken to your Canvas dashboard. On that dashboard, you should see a tile with the name of your course.

                If you don't see the tile before the course starts, that is not (yet) a problem. Our Canvas courses are created unpublished, which means they're hidden from students.

                Please remember that you can always email me (peter.brown@converse.edu) for Canvas questions. Dr. {prof_last_name} is a better source for all other questions.
